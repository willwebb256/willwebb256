- 👋 Hi, I’m @willwebb256
- 👀 I’m interested in hiking, surfing, snowboarding, music, pets, hanging out with friends and family
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much as I can about coding right now because to quote Ruth Langmore from Ozark, "I don't know Sh** about Fu**!" 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything related to the outdoors. Definitely want to build an app for an idea I had while hiking last week. 
- 📫 How to reach me: william.webb256@gmail.com
